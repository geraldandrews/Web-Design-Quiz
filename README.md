## Description
Web Design Quiz created from scratch. The quiz consists of 10 multiple choice questions where the user has 15 seconds to answer each question. There is a timer in the top left corner of the
quiz to keep the user aware of the time they have left to answer each question. After each question is answered, an alert pops up to let the user know if they selected the right or wrong
answer. If time expires before a question is answered an alert pops up as well letting the user know time has expired and question will be counted wrong. After the user completes the quiz, a
page opens with their quiz score along with an alert, letting the user know if they passed the quiz or not.
